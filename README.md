# Syllabus Creative Industries

Wheaton College
Instructor: Joerg Blumtritt

## Description

Creativity has long been seen as a pinacle of actualizing our potential as human beings. Over the last 25 years, creative industries, closely entangled with digital technologies, have risen to a key part of economic value creation. In this course we will look at this development, critically assess ideas and assumptions behind the concepts of creativity and the construction of creative industries, and explore the economic reality of creative businesses. Alongside introducing to ‘creative industries’ as an area of academic study, the course features experiments in creative expression in various technologies in practical exercises.

‘Creative Industries’ is offered as an advanced course for undergraduate students as well as a required part for the 4+1 master in Creative Industries. Undergraduate and graduate students will follow the same weekly schedule but receive different assignments honoring their individual position within their academic progress.

## General rules and remarks
### Accessibility Statement 
Wheaton College is committed to providing equitable access and supportive services for all students to fully access and thrive in the academic, residential and social aspects of student life at Wheaton College. Affirmatively, Wheaton provides appropriate accommodations for eligible students with documented disabilities to afford equal access to educational programs and services. Individuals with disabilities and other access concerns requiring accommodations or information on accessibility should reach out to Accessibility Services at the Filene Center, either via email at accessibility@wheatoncollege.edu or via phone at (508) 286-3794.


### Academic Honesty Statement
Established by students for the purpose of self-governance in 1921, The Honor Code is a commitment to the ideals of academic excellence and individual responsibility:

As members of the Wheaton community, we commit ourselves to act honestly, responsibly, and above all, with honor and integrity in all areas of campus life. We are accountable for all that we say and write. We are responsible for the academic integrity of our work. We pledge that we will not misrepresent our work nor give or receive unauthorized aid. We commit ourselves to behave in a manner which demonstrates concern for the personal dignity, rights and freedoms of all members of the community. We are respectful of college property and the property of others. We will not tolerate a lack of respect for these values.

### Attendance
#### Film, Digital Media and Communications - Attendance Policy
Regular class attendance is an important component of academic success and absolutely essential in Film, Digital Media, and Communication industries. You are allowed 2 absences without explanation. These are designed to cover minor illnesses and other mishaps. No other absences will be excused except for bereavement or unscheduled hospitalization. Any additional absences will lower the final course grade by a third of a letter for each class missed (e.g., B becomes B-, a C+ becomes a C, etc) and will require a meeting with the department chair. Five or more absences will result in an “F” in the course, unless there are exceptional circumstances that are documented with the office of Academic Advising. 

### Participation
- You are expected to participate in class discussions and group assignments.
- You may use electronic devices to take notes or when explicitly asked to do so. Please be considerate and don't waste your time by sitting in class while doing other things on your devices.
- Mobile phones have to be silenced during class time.
- Using social media during class time is not acceptable.

### Use of generative AI
Learning only happens as a result of effort on your part. You should not use these tools to replace the effort required for you to learn. Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help you generate ideas, practice for tests, and save time on repetitive tasks. They can also be a shortcut that limits what you get out of this class. 

You may use GenAI tools for generating ideas you modify or alternative options to choose from, but you should be thoughtful about selecting and editing the options.

Like with other sources, you are expected to acknowledge that use. Cite the tools you used, how you used them, and in what part of your process. 

You remain responsible for all aspects of your work. In any use of AI-generated material, you are responsible for its accuracy, and will be graded down for not catching errors the tool generates. You are also responsible for understanding the material in your assignments and expected to elaborate on any work you hand in.

Remember that these tools have the same ethical weaknesses, especially with regards to race and gender, exhibited on the broader internet.
